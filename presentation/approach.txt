**** GENERAL APPROACH **** 

Use a versatile model, like LightGBM - mainly due to not being overly familiar with a more standard Time Series Forecast approach

Create features that will best capture either:
 * the likely value for "unit_sales" (using various, potentially "rolling" historic statistics)
 * contextual information about why the historic statistics were what they were (e.g. long running promitions)
 * an indidcation as to what may cause a spike or drop in "unit_sales" in the next period given the day/store/item/promotion etc.

Thorough EDA to assist with the above

Note distribution of the target variable has many low values close to 0, but then a few very large positive (and some negative) values


**** EVALUATION AND ERROR METRICS *****

Use of standard RMSE and utilise the Kaggle evaluation metric if possible (use their weighting if possible)

Note their Metric penalises under-prediction higher than over (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDwlXqvc-vA&ab_channel=YanAITalk)

Look at predictions versus actuals to spot largest bias in model output




**** FEATURE SELECTION & CROSS VALIDATION *****

Given large feature set and limited time frames, keep this simple. Potentially lean on featureImportance from CV to guide selection

CV approach to be determined. LGB tuning important, out of the box it seemed to be over-fitting. 
May need to create validation slices that are like the 15-day out-sample slice
